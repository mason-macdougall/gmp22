Upsampled posterior chains for 25 planets in a simulated peas-in-a-pod system, fit using logT + umbrella sampling with *exoplanet*

- ROR     = 0.022
- ECC     = 0.
- SNR     = 20.
- PERIOD  ~ logU(3, 100)
- IMPACT  ~ U(0, 1)
- RHOSTAR = 1.401 +/- 0.1401
- LD_U = [0.4, 0.25]

Fixed parameters: LD_U, T0, PERIOD, as well as mean flux and jitter
